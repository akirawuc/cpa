# CPA protocol

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## TODO:

- [] Landing page

### Protocols features

- [] Add border solution to verify users:

  - All function that could retrieve a list of address should be support

- [] Add a GPT interface for people who are not familiar with generating the code to retrieve the address list

- [] Add hint for people who haven't created a campaign

### Influencer features

- [] Add in customizable NFT tokenURL for the "collab NFT"

### Audience featuers

- [] Refresh the worldcoin signin id application everytime -> since we should check whether the user mint the collab NFT only once

- [] (?) Maybe add support to Gitcoin passport?
